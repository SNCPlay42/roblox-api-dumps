This repository stores API dumps and ReflectionMetadata.xml for each
version of ROBLOX on gametest1-5 and www.roblox.com.

Currently the setup sites are checked hourly by an always-on
(hopefully!) machine, however as this machine is neither Windows nor
x86 there could be significantly long delays in processing the API
dumps. This situation may change in the future.
